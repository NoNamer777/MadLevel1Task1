This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development Course at HvA.

Users can try to guess if the next dice roll will be lower then, equal to, or higher then the previous dice roll.  
They get feedback in the form of a Toast message depending on the result of their guess.

The current dice roll is depicted in the image and the previous dice roll is mentioned below that image.
